# Brazillian Ecommerce Data Engineering Project on GCP

## Introduction

For this project, I streamlined a data pipeline by integrating Google Drive, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Looker Studio. Using Python and Cloud Composer, I automated data ingestion from Google Drive to a Cloud Storage bucket and BigQuery. The workflow included transformations in dbt and visualizations in Looker Studio for end-to-end data insights.
